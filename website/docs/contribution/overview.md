# Overview

Contributing to TerediX is a great way to help the open source community. We appreciate contributions of all kinds, from code to documentation, from small tweaks to significant features. Here are some of the ways you can contribute:

## Contribute to Codebase

If you're looking to code, start by checking out our [issues](https://github.com/shaharia-lab/terediX/issues). Here's how you can contribute:


- **Tackle Existing Issues**: Look for issues labeled **[good first issue](https://github.com/shaharia-lab/terediX/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22)** or **[help wanted](https://github.com/shaharia-lab/terediX/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22)** for ideas to start contributing.
- **Submit Pull Requests**: If you have a fix or feature in mind, feel free to create an issue first to discuss it. After the idea is fleshed out, submit a pull request (PR) for review.
